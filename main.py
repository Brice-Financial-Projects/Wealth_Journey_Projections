Monte Carlo Simulation for Retirement Savings

This Python script simulates the growth of retirement savings using a
Monte Carlo method. It estimates potential outcomes of different investment
scenarios by running numerous simulations, each with varying market
conditions. The script helps model the impact of factors such as annual
returns, volatility, and time horizons on retirement savings outcomes.

Developed in the VS Code editor.
